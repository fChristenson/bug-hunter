## What we will cover

* What is a bug?
* What types of bug are most common?
* How do we go about solving a bug?

## Notes

A bug is simply a unintentional behaviour in your program
that can result in a crash or that the program does something weird.

Every non trivial system has bugs, no exceptions.

The 2 most common bugs are programming errors or logical errors.

A programming error is code that will cause a error with a stacktrace.
These are usualy easy to track and solve and luckily they are the most common.

In second place we have logical bugs which simply means that we have written
code that is not behaving in the way we expect.

Logical bugs can be tricky because the program could work perfectly but
doing the wrong thing.
